ADS503 (Summer 2023)


## Introduction:
The final team project will evaluate the application of predictive modeling techniques introduced in this course. You and your teammate(s) will work closely to find a dataset (Healthcare, Biomedical, Life Sciences, or Biology topics are recommended in ADS 503), clean and pre-process it, and perform a comprehensive predictive modeling project on the data using R. It is strongly recommended that you and your team use and practice  GitHub  Click for more options for version control and collaboration during this project. It is also necessary to create and add a  README  Click for more options file to your GitHub repository. For creating the executive summary PowerPoint deck, you should review the How to Communicate with Non-technical Stakeholders tips and apply them to your presentation.

## Project Timeline:
Module 2 (by the end of Week 2): Your course instructor has assigned you to a 2-to-3-person group. Locate your team members and review all project requirements. 

Module 5 (by the end of Week 5): Your team selects and introduces a dataset. The team representative submits the "Team Project Status Update Form." 

Module 7 (by the end of Week 7): Each team should submit the following deliverables for the course project in this final week:
One 10-15 minute video presentation by all team members.
One PDF document containing a technical report explanation for analyses, interpretations (10-12 pages), and code (Appendix).
One PDF or PPT document (at most 5 slides) containing slides with an executive summary of the project for a non-technical audience.

*It is critical to note that no extensions will be given for any of the final projects' due dates for any reason, and final projects submitted after the final due date will not be graded.

## Project Datasets:
You will be responsible for finding a dataset for this final team project. Several free data resourcesâ€™ links are provided within the Resources page on the MS-ADS GitHub website.

## Requirements: 
Divide the work equally between the team members for the following steps, and everyone needs to code. You are expected to write high-quality, efficient, and readable code in R. This project requires that you and your team conduct a video presentation, submit a technical report, and create an executive summary PowerPoint presentation.

For your video presentation:
Give a 10-15 minute presentation based on your technical report.
Include a technical explanation of the following:
The clearly defined problem statement and data description 
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data pre-processing
Data splitting
Model building strategies
Model performance and hyperparameter tuning
Results and final model selection
Optional: Demonstration of R Shiny web application of the project
Discussion and conclusion (particularly present: how did you frame the problem as a predictive modeling solution?)
Your audience for this video is your data science peers/technical audience with the knowledge of data science methods and techniques.

For your technical report:
Include a clearly defined problem statement.
Describe your analysis of the data.
Include a detailed solution.
You can include graphs and output tables only if you use them in your discussion.
This section is intended for a statistically literate/technical audience and must be written in a clear, organized fashion.
You can use the case studies from Chapters 10 and 17 on how to build your predictive modeling analysis.
You can organize the report into subsections such as:
Problem statement and justification for the proposed approach
EDA (graphical and non-graphical representations of relationships between the response variable and predictor variables)
Data wrangling and pre-processing (handling of missing values, outliers, correlated features, etc.)
Data splitting (training, validation, and test sets)
Model strategies (describing main research questions and appropriate analytics methods)
Validation and testing (model tuning and evaluation)
Results and final model selection (performance measures, etc.)
Discussion and conclusions (address the problem statement and suggestions/solutions could go beyond the scope of the course)
Appendix (reproducible and clean R code)

For your executive summary PowerPoint:
Should be no longer than 5 slides.
Introduce the problem statement.
Discuss the solutions that were explored.
Describe the conclusions of your data analysis to a non-technical audience.
Should be intelligible to a person who does not know predictive modeling techniques.
Suppose you are submitting a report to a Director/VP/Executive-level audience who are not familiar with statistical terminology and predictive modeling methods. This can be seen as the executive summary/introduction of your report.
You will want to present your analysis like a story instead of a technical report. You should articulate your final model results for everyone to understand.
